Multithreading Scenario Ananlysis:

Theme: Restaurant Operations

This document describes real-world scenarios to help you decide when multithreading is necessary.

Scenario 1: Small Coffee shop with 1 Customer

Problem : A single customer orders a coffee.  
Multithreading Needed? No

- Only one task (preparing coffee) exists.
- Sequential processing is efficient and simple.  
  Restaurant Analogy:
- A single chef can handle the order without delays.
- No parallel tasks required.

---

Scenario 2: Banquet with 500 Guests

Problem: Serve 500 guests simultaneously with a 10-item menu.  
Multithreading Needed.

- Hundreds of orders need parallel processing.
- Sequential execution would cause delays.

  Restaurant Analogy:

- Multiple chefs (threads) cook different dishes concurrently.
- Waiters (threads) deliver orders while others are being prepared.

---

Scenario 3: Real-Time Order Tracking Dashboard

Problem: Display live updates for 1000+ ongoing orders.  
Multithreading Needed.

- The dashboard must update independently of backend order processing.
- Blocking the UI thread would freeze the display.

  Restaurant Analogy :

- A manager (UI thread) monitors the dashboard while chefs (worker threads) cook.

Scenario 4: Updating a Shared Bill with Multiple Waiters

Problem: Two waiters add items to the same table’s bill.  
Multithreading Needed.

- Concurrent writes to shared data (bill amount) risk corruption.
- Threads must coordinate to avoid race conditions.

  Restaurant Analogy:

- Waiters use a "token" (synchronized method) to update the bill one at a time.

Scenario 5: Processing 10,000 Online Food Delivery Orders

Problem: Handle a surge of orders during peak hours.  
Multithreading Needed.

- Creating 10,000 threads would crash the system (overhead).
- A thread pool efficiently reuses threads for bulk tasks.  
  Restaurant Analogy:
- A team of 20 chefs (thread pool) handles orders in batches instead of hiring 10,000 temp workers.

Scenario 6: Single Cashier at a Quiet Café

Problem: Process payments for 2-3 customers per hour.  
Multithreading Needed? No

- Low traffic doesn’t justify concurrency overhead.
- A single thread (cashier) is sufficient.
